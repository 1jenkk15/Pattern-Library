Intro

The use of pattern libraries is forever increasing within development, using this technique to improve and evaluate the current processes. When reusing components in software development increases productivity and overall quality to a site. Where studies have been conducted on the popularity of these techniques and was discovered only 13% used pattern libraries to aid design. Understanding the benefits of ready to use components and being able to apply them where necessary are the reasons being this project. Using digital design to experiment, design and implement six components within a pattern library. These must be shown, with validated code to meet required standards and documented on directions of use.

Components within:

Button one is the default for the jumbo-tron, this is eye catching and will bring the attention of the user.
Button two is the default for the site, this has a hover over effect that brings up two arrows on the left of the text.
Button 3 is a gradient, this can be edited with any colour to fit the needs of a website.
Button 4 is a hover button that turns purple when the cursor is above.
Button 5 is the opposite of button 4, where it changes to cream on hover.
Button 6 is the ghost button, this is more subtle and simple approach used.

This is the header componant, this would be placed on the top of a website. This will be the first image the user should see when opening a new page.
This is the navigation componant, this is a horizontal navbar. This shows how the user will get around the website between each pages.
This is the Jumbotron componant, this is an eye catching section of the site. This is used to get users to access new pages, where the example shows previous work.
This is the pagination, this is how you can locate around each page
 on the website.
This is the footer element, its like a bottom navigation system with social media links
